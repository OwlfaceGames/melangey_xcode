## About

Melangey brings the cozy, warm aesthetic of the melange Neovim theme to Xcode with some thoughtful modifications:

- **Darker background** for reduced eye strain during long coding sessions
- **Pale green cursor** for better visibility and a touch of nature
- **Dark blue selection highlight** for clear text selection
- **Vim-friendly highlighting** that respects your workflow - no current line highlighting unless in insert mode

## Features

- Warm, earthy color palette that's easy on the eyes
- High contrast syntax highlighting for better code readability
- Consistent theming across all Xcode interface elements (editor, console, debugger)
- Optimized for both light and dark room environments
- Carefully chosen colors that maintain accessibility standards
